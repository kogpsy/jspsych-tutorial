# Prequisites and resources

You might be able to follow along to reach the specific goal that this tutorial deals with without any prior knowledge of programming. But to understand it in more depth, and maybe even transfer this understanding to different goals, a small foundation might be useful. Especially some understanding of basic JavaScript concepts could make the learning process a lot easier. A list of (external) resources to help you build that foundation is provided below. Also, if new concepts are introduced throughout this book, there will be links to articles that explain them in detail.

Depending on your type and background knowledge, you might want to learn some basics first and start with the tutorial afterwards, or you dive right into it and consult these resources if you face any problems or don't understand something.

**JavaScript and web technologies**

JavaScript is the language that you will write your experiments in. It is commonly used to add interactivity to websites. `jsPsych` experiments are interactive websites too, essentially. To program simple experiments, basics of JavaScript should suffice. Mozilla has a [great crashcourse chapter][javascript-basics-crashcourse] on that.

If you want to go crazy and use the full power of the web in your experiments, you might want to learn about HTML and CSS and web technologies in general. Consider taking a look at [this more general tutorial][web-basics] (the crashcourse chapter mentioned above is a part of it). Check Mozilla's [mdn web docs][mdn] if you want to know more about a specific piece of web technology.

**`git`**

**Yarn**
