# Introduction to jsPsych

_Robin Bürkli, April 2022_

## Preface

The world of programming is full of possibilities and options. To achieve a certain goal there is often a multitude of tools available which promise to make achieving the goal easier, and a single tool, once chosen, can in turn be used in many different ways. This can make the process from the idea to the concrete solution pretty complex for people without much previous experience in programming. Also, in teams aiming towards the same goal, this freedom can mean that different team members work with different tools, or use the same tool in different ways. This can make communication and collaboration difficult, what can lead to chaos.

This brief, tutorial-like book aims to provide some guidance for individuals and teams alike, by teaching one specific way of using one specific tool to achieve a certain goal. This book is therefore quite [opinionated][opinionated-software] and should by no means be taken as the objective truth or **the right way™**.

The tool of interest is [`jsPsych`][jspsych], which will be used to achieve the goal of programming a behavioral online experiment. The way of using `jsPsych` that will be teached mainly builds upon an [experiment template][jspsych-template] to make getting started easier as well as to standardize the experiment structure within teams, and [`jspsych-builder`][jspsych-builder] to make the development and publishing process more convenient. These building blocks will be introduced gradually throughout the book, so worry not if you don't know them yet.

One last thing: if you stumble across any errors or untruths, feel free to help improving this work by [opening an issue on GitHub][github-repo].
